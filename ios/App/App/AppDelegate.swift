// UIScene life cycle (2026-10-29). Apps built with the iOS 27 SDK must adopt
// it: without a scene manifest UIKit stops the launch (EXC_BREAKPOINT in
// _UIApplicationEvaluateRuntimeIssueForNoSceneLifecycleAdoption — reproduced
// on the iPhone Duo simulator, Xcode 27.1 / iOS 27.1), and Xcode 27.1 is what
// gives the app the Duo's full inner display instead of a letterbox.
// Info.plist UIApplicationSceneManifest points here and at Main.storyboard, so
// UIKit still builds the window + CAPBridgeViewController exactly as before.
// With scenes, link opens arrive on the scene, not the AppDelegate methods
// above — they are forwarded to Capacitor the same way. (Lives in this file so
// the Xcode project needs no new file reference.)
